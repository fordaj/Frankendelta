# Marlin Firmware
[Marlin firmware](https://marlinfw.org) version 2.0.7.2, last flashed 12-13-2020.

## configuration.h
All of the changes I've made to the [configuration.h](configuration.h) file. Since I am using a delta printer, I started with the generic example in [Marlin's configuration repository](https://github.com/MarlinFirmware/Configurations).
