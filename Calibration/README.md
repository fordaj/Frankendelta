## Belt Tensioning
1. Choose a frequency meter; I used my iPhone with the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/easy-tension/id1093873727">Easy Tension</a> application.
2. Move the belt carriages halfway down their rails
3. Measure the distance L (cm) from the stepper motor to the pulley
4. Adjust belt tension until it matches the desired frequency f = 3600/L. In my case, f = 3600/98cm = 36.7Hz
